\section{Conclusion} \label{con}
Researchers have proposed numerous approaches for detecti
ng
the ever-increasing number of web sites spreading malware v
ia
drive-by downloads. Adversaries have responded with a numb
er
of techniques to bypass detection. This paper studies wheth
er eva-
sive practices are effective, and whether they are being pur
sued at
a large scale.
Our study focuses on the four most prevalent detections tech

pots, Classification based on Domain Reputation, and Anti-V

Engines. We measure the extent to which evasion affects each
of
these schemes by analyzing four years worth of data collecte
d by
Google SafeBrowsing infrastructure. Our experiments corr
oborate 
our hypothesis that malware authors continue to pursue deli
very
mechanisms that can confuse different malware detection sy
stems.
We find that Social Engineering is growing and poses challeng
es to
VM-based honeypots.
